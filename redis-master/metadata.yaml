  Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store.
  It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys 
  can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.
  You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending 
  to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; 
  computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the 
  member with highest ranking in a sorted set.
  In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with 
  an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist 
  it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, 
  or by appending each command to a log.
  Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, 
  Keys with a limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to 
  make Redis behave like a cache.
  This charm provides a standalone Redis Master. For addition
  documentation and configuration options refer to http://redis.io
